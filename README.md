# Effect size and sample size trends over time in autism research

This repository houses files, data, and code for a re-analysis of data from RÃ¸dgaard et al., (2019) (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2747847).

This re-analysis accompanies Lombardo (2021), Autism Research, which is a response to a commentary by Mottron (2021), Autism Research.

The file `autism_es_time_n.html` within the `code` directory has the reproducible analysis which shows statistics and plots.
